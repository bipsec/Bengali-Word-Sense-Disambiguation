# Bengali-Word-Sense-Disambiguation
Due to recent technical and scientific advances in Bangla, Natural Language Processing plays a very important role in the field of Bengali Machine Translation, Information Extraction, Retrieval, and so on. Word Sense Disambiguation is one of the most emergent tasks in this field. This paper address the Disambiguation technique in Bengali Language and a well-annotated corpus has been developed for this purpose. In this paper, we have built a system design to detect the actual sense for each ambiguous word and the outcome of the assessment indicates that the word sense that we proposed is 79.6\%. However, when dealing with a large number of ambiguous words in a single language or technological domain, we can run into stumbling blocks when deploying existing WSD models.
